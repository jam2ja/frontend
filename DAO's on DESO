Interested to see how music artists/producers/management might be able to tap in here with the project/technology.
Example:
1)-The artist mints NFTs to raise  from fans/supporters/investors. Meme coin nft.
2)-NFTs sell.
3)-Artist's creates project in the  Desos dao using wallet with NFT sale funds. Treasury wallet.
4)-All the people involved in the production arrive to the homebase dao. Bass player, drummer, producer, video producer. Each have their own wallet, able to engage and create band/production issues that need to be voted on.
5)-Rewards paid via smart contract directly after vote.
6)-Potentially system also used to regulate FIAT balances, allow transparency.
7)-Treasury is governed via the band.
8)-It's possible it could also be configured so that fans/supporters/investors can see what is happening within the dao and vote where appropriate. Concert tours and so on, where to have shows, ticket placement NFT drops and so on.
9)-Potentially NFT contributors (fans) can also be a part of the voting and governance protocols. For concerts.
10)-Also the potential of fans/supporters/investors to share in the rewards when the project is minted/licensed and presented to the blockchain.
11)-Different types of NFTs sold give different governance. Fan NFTs, Investor NFTs, Management NFTs.



Is this the right place for these kind of ideas? Apologies if i put this in the wrong place, always a little confused when submitting ideas on github.
